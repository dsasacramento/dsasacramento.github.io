We need your financial support to keep building a socialist movement in the Capital City. Whether it's strike support, canvassing, membership meetings, or educational events, your contributions make our organizing possible.

*Sacramento DSA relies on donations to do its work, but donating isn't the same as joining. To join the Democratic Socialists of America, please sign up at <https://dsausa.org/join>*

Additionally, you can contribute to our ongoing Mutual Aid efforts in the myriad of ways that we seek to address the lack of resources for so many, by becoming a contributing member to our <a class="btn btn-primary" href="[/about/committees](https://www.patreon.com/SacDSAMutualAid)"> Mutual Aid Patreon</a>
