Sacramento DSA is the chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America that covers the Sacramento region. The Democratic Socialists of America is an organization dedicated to educating and organizing the global working class, so that we may move beyond Capitalism;  Capitalism is a system designed by the owning class to exploit the rest of us for their own profit. We must replace it with democratic socialism, a system where ordinary people have a real voice in our workplaces, neighborhoods, and society.

We believe there are many avenues that feed into the democratic road to socialism. Our vision pushes further than historic social democracy and leaves behind authoritarian visions of socialism in the dustbin of history.

We want a democracy that creates space for us all to flourish not just survive and answers the fundamental questions of our lives with the input of all. We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear. We want to win “radical” reforms like single-payer Medicare for All, defunding the police/refunding communities, the Green New Deal, and more as a transition to a freer, more just life. 

We want a democracy powered by everyday people. The capitalist class tells us we are powerless, but together we can take back control.

Join DSA to further the cause of democratic socialism in your town and across the nation.

We are funded and managed by our members. Our chapter structure consists of an **Executive Board** made up of seven elected officers and numerous **Committees** focused on various types of work both internal and external. We also have a yearly **Local Convention** where we vote on resolutions and go over our Chapter Report.
