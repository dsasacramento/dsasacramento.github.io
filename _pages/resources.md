#### Bylaws

Bylaws are the basic rules that define how an organization governs itself. For Sacramento DSA, as an organization committed to democratic governance by its members, our bylaws' most important function is to establish the democratic structures through which we make decisions, carry out collective goals, and elect accountable leaders.

#### National Harassment and Grievance Policy

Democratic Socialists of America is committed to creating a space that is welcoming and inclusive to members of all genders, races, classes, and abilities. At our 2017 convention, we passed [Resolution #33](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/dsausa/mailings/1795/attachments/original/DSA_Harassment_Resolution.pdf?1511384152), which provides guidelines to ensure that everyone is able to organize without fear of harassment, abuse, or harm. The resolution also establishes a process to handle these types of charges between members.
