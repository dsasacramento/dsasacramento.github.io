## Name.

The name of the Local shall be the Sacramento Local of the Democratic Socialists of America, also known colloquially as DSA Sacramento or Sacramento DSA.

## Purpose.
The Sacramento Local of the Democratic Socialists of America seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially controlled. 

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race and sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. 

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships. 

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central. 

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society.

This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population. 

## Meetings.
Sacramento DSA will hold a minimum of four General Membership Meetings annually. The General Membership will elect local officers and may adopt an annual budget. In general, it is the highest legislative body of the Local.

## Committees.

####  Formation of Committees

Ideas for committees must be proposed in front of the General Membership. At that time, three dues-paying members in total must come forward, stating their willingness to participate in the committee. An Organizer must also come forward, stating their willingness to sponsor and assume responsibility for the committee. If and when these requirements are met, the group is assigned “working group” status. The group then is tasked with the following, to be completed by the next general membership meeting:

  - Hold a meeting and elect a committee chair (committee chairs may not be Officers)
  - Prepare a presentation to be given in front of the general membership, outlining the purpose and intent of the committee

Following the presentation, the General Membership will vote to ratify the proposed committee. A committee needs to acquire a simple majority vote in favor in order to proceed.

#### Committee Operations

Committee Chairs are encouraged to take notes at every meeting.  All committee notes need to be public to members in good standing and the chapter steering committee.  Committee notes should also be stored in whatever digital drive or digital archive the chapter leadership decides to use. Committee Chairs are also responsible for making sure communication between the committee and the steering committee is frequent and transparent. Committees are allowed to self-dismantle at any time, however the chairs of dismantled committees are still responsible for alerting the membership and chapter leaders that the committee is discontinued.

Committees that report having 3 or less members attend after three consecutive meetings are at risk of facing a proposal for dismantling by the steering committee. The steering committee shall meet with the committee’s chair(s) and review the committee’s status before introducing any such proposal. If a proposal to terminate is approved by a vote of the General Membership, the committee is officially terminated. Terminated committees shall have their budgets redistributed proportionally to the still existing committees.

Each Committee will establish and monitor a committee email. 

Committee leadership will send one representative per month to a Steering Committee meeting. The committee representative will communicate with the Steering Committee and other committee representatives about their committee's upcoming events and what resources or support they require from the broader Chapter.

Committees must bring all committee expenditures and campaigns before the Steering Committee, so such actions may be scheduled for the General Membership Meeting. 

Committees must seek the approval of the General Membership for all campaigns. Committee chairs must report all events and campaigns to the Chapter's Communciation Director for publicity. 

In the event that a committee faces a time-sensitive motion that cannot be brought before the General Membership before action is required, that committee may bring the motion before the Steering Committee for approval by consent. 

A vote of the General Membership may dismantle committees, brought about by: recommendation of the Steering Committee; or recommendation by any General Member, for reasons such as violating DSA Sacramento bylaws. Committees may also self-dismantle at any time. 

The Chapter's Secretary or Communications Director will be responsible for deleting defunct committees from the chapter-wide communications applications. 

Committees are expected to help manage press inquiries regarding committee business. 

Committees must conduct yearly, publicized elections. Elections should be publicized at minimum of 2 weeks in advance.

2.) You have attended two consecutive committee meetings and your attendance is recorded in the committee’s reported notes.
3.) You are the elected co-chair(s) of the committee

Only SacDSA members in good standing are allowed to call themselves committee members.

There shall be no limitation on how many committees one member in good standing can join.

## Working Groups.

Ideas for Working Groups must be proposed in front of the General Membership. At that time, two dues-paying members in total must come forward, stating their willingness to participate in the working group. The purpose of the working group, as well as the expected end-date of the project, must also be stated. 

Following the proposal, the General Membership will vote whether or not to give permission to proceed with the working group. A working group needs to acquire a simple majority vote in favor in order to proceed. 

Working groups must report to the Steering Committee. All working group actions must be brought before the Steering Committee for consent.

Working groups must report all actions and campaigns to the Media Committee for publicity. 

Working groups may seek a deadline extension by vote of the General Membership. 

Working groups may be dismantled by a vote of the General Membership, brought about by: recommendation of the Steering Committee; or recommendation by any General Member, for reasons such as violating DSA Sacramento bylaws. Working groups may also self-dismantle at any time. 

## Membership.

Members of the Sacramento DSA are those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full. It will be the responsibility of members to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the local chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA. 

Individuals whose dues to national DSA are unpaid may still participate as non-voting volunteers. These non-voting volunteers may not hold office, may not chair committees or working groups, and may not count toward quorum.

If a member is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA, or if that member is found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or if that member is found to be under the discipline of any self-defined democratic centralist organization, the Local may vote to expel her/him from DSA. In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prefer written charges against the member in question to the Local Steering Committee, which shall set the date of a Local meeting for deliberations on the charges. The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before that meeting takes place. Expulsion of a member or affiliate member requires a two-thirds vote of the Local meeting. An expelled member may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA. 

## Voting and Election Procedures.

Above-stated quorum requirements must be upheld for all votes and elections. 

Voting in all elections will be conducted by secret ballot, also known as the Australian ballot, either on paper or digitally. 

Other votes not specified above may be conducted as the parliamentarian sees fit. 

Above-stated quorum requirement and voting procedures apply to officer elections and delegate elections. 

At the time of each vote, it must be reiterated that non-dues-paying volunteers must refrain from voting.

## Rules of the Local.

The Rules contained in Robert’s Rules of Order, Newly Revised, shall govern this Local in cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these Bylaws.

Any action taken by an officer or member of the Local in contravention of these Bylaws is null and void.

## Chapter Electoral Endorsements.

All of the chapter’s electoral endorsements, whether they are for a candidate or a ballot measure campaign, must be approved through a vote by the membership using Opavote or other similar electronic voting platforms as approved by the Steering Committee.

Endorsements shall only be approved by a ⅗ majority vote (or 60%) of a quorum of 5% of the chapter’s general membership.

The process for considering a candidate for chapter endorsement shall follow the following steps.


1. The candidate (or an appropriate representative of the candidate), or a member in good standing representing a ballot measure campaign, shall contact the steering committee to request a vote for the chapter endorsement.
1.  Either one or both co-chairs shall be in contact with the candidate or representative. The co-chair(s) shall send the candidate our chapter’s endorsement questionnaire.  
1. A candidate seeking our endorsement must return their questionnaire no later than 6 months before the date of their election to be considered for a chapter endorsement.  
1. Upon receiving the completed candidate questionnaire, a forum conducted by the chapter’s electoral committee open to the entire chapter membership shall take place with the candidate no later than 5 months before the election date.  If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, this task shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. Following the forum, the chapter’s electoral committee shall vote on a recommendation for the endorsement.  Following the vote, a recommendation either in favor or against endorsement shall be written by representatives of the electoral committee for the membership to review.  If the committee cannot come to a united consensus, then both the cases for and against the endorsement must be written into the report. If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, these tasks shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. The report from the forum shall be presented to the membership at least 5 months before the election date for the members to vote on.  The report shall be presented either during a general membership meeting or online via email depending on the timeframe between the forum and election. The vote shall take place online via Opavote or other similar approved online voting platforms as needed. 
1. Online votes must remain open until the 5% quorum for participation is reached so long as it does not conflict with the 5 month deadline.  If quorum is not met before the appropriate deadline, the motion for the endorsement fails.

The process for considering a ballot measure for chapter endorsement shall take the following steps.

1. A member in good standing representing a ballot measure campaign shall contact the steering committee to request a vote for the chapter endorsement no later than 6 months before the date of the election to be considered for a chapter endorsement, unless the ballot measure is a special election already endorsed by National or California DSA.
1. Either one or both co-chairs shall be in contact with the member in good standing.
1. Upon receiving the endorsement request for a ballot measure campaign from a member in good standing, a forum conducted by the chapter’s electoral committee open to the entire chapter membership shall take place no later than 5 months before the election, unless the ballot measure is a special election already endorsed by National or California DSA. If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, this task shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. Following the forum, the chapter’s electoral committee shall vote on a recommendation for the endorsement. Following the vote, a recommendation either in favor or against endorsement shall be written by representatives of the electoral committee for the membership to review. If the committee cannot come to a united consensus, then both the cases for and against the endorsement must be written into the report. If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, these tasks shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. The report from the forum shall be presented to the membership at least 5 months before the election date for the members to vote, excluding special elections already endorsed by National or California DSA. 
1. The report shall be presented either during a general membership meeting or online via email depending on the timeframe between the forum and election. A vote shall take place online.The vote shall take place via online polls.
1. Online votes must remain open until the 5% quorum for participation is reached so long as it does not conflict with the 5 month deadline. If quorum is not met before the appropriate deadline, the motion for the endorsement fails.


If the chapter votes to make an endorsement, this means the chapter’s general membership is in agreement that the chapter shall:

1. Provide some form of volunteer labor for the campaign such as sending canvassers, phone bankers, text bankers, at large committee volunteers, host fundraisers, host canvassing events, or anything else that is agreed upon by the membership at the time of the endorsement vote.
1. Decide whether the chapter’s endorsement will take the form of an Independent Expenditure (IE) Campaign or a Coordinated Campaign (CC).[^1]
1. Develop a relationship with the endorsed candidate, staffers, and/or representatives of a ballot measure campaign that will continue after the election.
1. Give priority consideration to endorsements for candidates who are members in good standing, provided the member has followed the procedure laid out above.
1. Understand that SacDSA endorsements are not just symbolic gestures, but are physical and potentially financial commitments we make as a chapter that will require the use of chapter resources.

If a candidate or campaign is exposed for doing anything antithetical to DSA’s values, the steering committee is within its right to call a special meeting of the general membership to vote on retracting the endorsement.  Endorsement retractions must meet the same voting quorums listed above and be conducted either in general meetings or online.

[^1]: An IE means we as a chapter would run our own campaign for the candidate or measure and have less restrictions on the amounts we can spend on the campaign, but could legally not coordinate with the main campaign and would require more intense accounting of our campaign expenses and donations to avoid legal complications.  A CC is a campaign where we are in direct contact with the main campaign and would be limited to approximately $5000 in donations per election cycle but require less legal oversight for campaign donations and expenses.

## Sacramento DSA Blog ##
The Sac DSA blog shall prioritize publishing the following types of articles:
1. Op-Eds - Opinion articles by members about DSA debates that affect our chapter’s internal organizing or external campaigns, and public issues relevant to Sacramento.
Example: [Procedural Debates at Local Convention](https://sacdsa.org/SacDSA-Local-Convention-2023-debate-bylaws/)

1. Steering Committee Statements - Statements made on behalf of the chapter in response to local and national emergencies.
Example: [Chapter Statement on the seating of Bret Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court](https://sacdsa.org/blog/2018/2018-10-05-sac_dsa_kavanaugh_statement/)

1. Political Education - Articles about theory in line with the [Sac DSA mission statement](https://sacdsa.org/resources/mission-statement/) and/or the history of socialist politics.
Example: [A People of Color’s History of DSA](https://sacdsa.org/blog/2019/2019-08-13-a-people-of-color-s-history-of-dsa-part-1-socialism-race-and-the-formation-of-dsa/)

Sac DSA’s blog is also open to citizen journalism, such as exposés on local politics or police corruption or interviews about campaigns or DSA history, SO LONG AS ALL JOURNALISTIC PIECES ARE DULY FACT CHECKED! Sac DSA as a chapter will not assume legal responsibility for members who use the blog to commit libel.

Members should consult [The Truth in Journalism Fact-Checking Guide](https://thetijproject.ca/guide/reporter-guidelines/) if they have questions about how to approach fact-checking. 

All articles must be in line with the [chapter mission statement](https://sacdsa.org/resources/mission-statement/), with the understanding that interpretations of the mission statement might vary in op-ed pieces. Also, authors of op-eds shall make it clear through the language of their article that their position is not the official chapter position, but is the member’s interpretation of the issue and Sac DSA’s mission statement. Members are welcome and encouraged to submit rebuttals to opinion pieces.

The Secretary and Communications Director shall serve as the chapter blog’s Co Editors-In-Chief, provided that they post drafts in the Steering Committee chat within 24 hours and shall wait 24 hours for potential Steering Committee objections before final drafts are posted. In the case where the Secretary and Comms Director disagree about approving a piece for publication, the decision for publication shall be put to a vote by the Steering Committee. Steering Committee members' votes should reflect on whether or not the piece is in line with the Sac DSA mission statement, not if they agree or disagree with the article.

Articles must be written in good faith and with the intention of growing DSA or educating our members and/or the public. If it is related to an internal DSA issue or point of debate, the article shall take the tone of “how DSA can do better” and will prioritize using uplifting language while avoiding character attacks on other comrades and ad hominem fallacies.
