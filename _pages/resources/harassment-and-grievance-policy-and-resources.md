*Learn about the resources and policies we have in place to ensure our chapter is welcoming and inclusive to members of all genders, races, classes, and abilities.*

At our 2017 convention, we passed [Resolution 33](https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/harassment-policy-resolution-33/), which provides guidelines to ensure that everyone is able to organize without fear of harassment, abuse, or harm. The resolution also establishes a process to handle these types of charges between members.

**If you are experiencing harassment or abusive behavior from a member please report it here.**

### What types of situations does our Harassment Policy, Resolution 33, cover?

**The Harassment Policy addresses prohibited behavior such as:**

- Harassment on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, race, color, religion, national origin, class, age, or profession.
- Harassing or abusive behavior, such as unwelcome attention, inappropriate or offensive remarks, slurs, or jokes, physical or verbal intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact or proximity, and other verbal and physical conduct constitute harassment when:
   - Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a member’s continued affiliation with DSA;
   - Submission or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for organizational decisions affecting such individual; or
   - Such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating a hostile environment interfering with an individual’s capacity to organize within DSA.

### How do I report harassment?
**You can report any incident you believe constitutes harassment or abusive behavior here:**

If you have any doubts of whether you are experiencing harassment, our local Harassment Grievance Officers (HGOs) are always available to talk through your experience and help decide how best to help.

### Who are the local Harassment Grievance Officers?

Our local Harassment Grievance Officers are chapter members that are the designated contacts for receiving reports of potential harassment. After a member reaches out the HGOs to report a potential incident or situation where they are experiencing harassment, the HGOs will talk with the member and help guide them through potential action steps including a dialogue or mediation between all parties. If a mediation or dialogue is not possible or appropriate, the HGOs can help the member file a formal grievance.

Our local HGOs are:

- Kyle L.
- Thomas G.

The HGOs may also be contacted directly at
