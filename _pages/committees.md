## Where the work happens

Sacramento DSA has many committees engaged in the important work of the chapter,
addressing the needs of the community and allowing the members to work on issues
that are important to them.

### Electoral Committee

The purpose of SacDSA's Electoral Committee is to build coalitions to support 
DSA-endorsed candidates and ballot initiatives.  

Our short term focus is to identify and prioritize centers of powerin the 
community such as schools, parks, libraries, agencies etc. and build 
from those centers of power.

Our long term focus is to develop a comprehensive candidate recruitment and assesment process in accordance with SacDSA's politics and bylaws.


### Healthcare Committee

At SacDSA’s Healthcare Committee, we know that access to quality healthcare can change lives - 
and we’re committed to making that a reality. We’re striving to enact legislation which would
create a health care system covering every person - with no copays, no deductibles and no one
excluded. The Healthcare Committee is proud to collaborate with the California Nurses Association
to fight for CalCare (California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act), and with National Nurses
United to champion a Medicare for All - Style system across the United States. Our comrades are
tabling at farmers’ markets, meeting with legislators, organizing actions at their offices,
sponsoring town halls, phone and text banking, and knocking on doors to build grassroots support.
Join us in the struggle for healthcare justice.

### International Committee

The International Committee of Sacramento DSA is fighting to link the struggles 
of the U.S. working class with those who struggle against imperialism 
and capitalist power across the globe. Our work is to promote education about
international issues and to offer solidarity and support to the international
working class and anti-colonial struggles for self-determination abroad. 
We fight for a free Palestine, open borders, and the liberation of all 
indigenous peoples.

### Labor Committee

Want to learn about and get support in building power in your workplace to make
real change for you and your co-workers? Join the Labor Committee at our next
meeting.

### Mutual Aid Committee

Under capitalism, the commodification of housing and other basic human needs
puts us and our neighbors in a constant state of precariousness. Federal, state,
and local governments have consistently failed to meet the needs of all
residents, especially unhoused residents. We as socialists believe in the need
for mutual aid to challenge the existing power structure and provide for those
marginalized and persecuted by the status quo, especially our BIPOC and LQBTQ+
who are more likely to face housing and food insecurity. We also believe it is
important to empower DSA members and members of the local community to make
meaningful systemic change.

The Mutual Aid Committee works to organize exchanges of resources and services
for the benefit of all. Through this collective effort, we will empower our
community to bring about systemic changes that will mitigate housing and food
insecurity in the region. Comrades will work together to assess what people need
and what the group can provide. Projects will be run by the community, for the
community, as mutual aid is fundamentally an organic and egalitarian social
relationship, not a material one based on hierarchy. We also believe it is
important to empower DSA members and members of the local community to make
meaningful systemic change (outside of existing systems).

### Racial Solidarity Committee

The mission of the Sacramento DSA Racial Solidarity committee is to fight systemic racism and build solidarity with and support for oppressed and marginalized people in the Sacramento Region through education, direct action, and mutual aid. We are committed to bringing an anti-racist lens to all work that Sacramento DSA engages with, and to provide tools for educating ourselves and our community on anti-racist work and theory.

### Socialist Education Committee

One of the defining features of socialism is the praxis, the meeting of theory
and action. The Socialist Education Committee creates events and materials to
aid our members in using the history and ideology of the socialist movement as
tools in our day-to-day organizing.

### Trans Rights and Bodily Autonomy Committee

TRBA committee merged with Mutual Aid Committee in July 2025.
