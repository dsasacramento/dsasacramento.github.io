## Name.

The name of the Local shall be the Sacramento Local of the Democratic Socialists of America, also known colloquially as DSA Sacramento or Sacramento DSA.

## Purpose.
The Sacramento Local of the Democratic Socialists of America seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially controlled. 

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race and sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. 

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships. 

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central. 

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society.

This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population. 

## Meetings.
Sacramento DSA will hold a minimum of four General Membership Meetings annually. The General Membership will elect local officers and may adopt an annual budget. In general, it is the highest legislative body of the Local.

## Committees.

####  Formation of Committees

Ideas for committees must be proposed in front of the General Membership. At that time, three dues-paying members in total must come forward, stating their willingness to participate in the committee. An Organizer must also come forward, stating their willingness to sponsor and assume responsibility for the committee. If and when these requirements are met, the group is assigned “working group” status. The group then is tasked with the following, to be completed by the next general membership meeting:

  - Hold a meeting and elect a committee chair (committee chairs may not be Officers)
  - Prepare a presentation to be given in front of the general membership, outlining the purpose and intent of the committee

Following the presentation, the General Membership will vote to ratify the proposed committee. A committee needs to acquire a simple majority vote in favor in order to proceed.

#### Committee Operations

Committee Chairs are required to make sure notes are taken at every meeting and sent to the SacDSA email within 24 hours after the meeting’s conclusion. Committee Chairs are also required to take attendance at each meeting, including the names of attendees, and report said attendance in their notes. Committees that do not provide the steering committee with this information regularly assume the risk of being dismantled via a vote by the General Membership.

Committees that report having 3 or less members attend after three consecutive meetings are at risk of facing a proposal for dismantling by the steering committee. The steering committee shall meet with the committee’s chair(s) and review the committee’s status before introducing any such proposal. If a proposal to terminate is approved by a vote of the General Membership, the committee is officially terminated. Terminated committees shall have their budgets redistributed proportionally to the still existing committees.

Each Committee will establish and monitor a committee email. 

Committee leadership will send one representative per month to a Steering Committee meeting. The committee representative will communicate with the Steering Committee and other committee representatives about their committee's upcoming events and what resources or support they require from the broader Chapter.

Committees must bring all committee expenditures and campaigns before the Steering Committee, so such actions may be scheduled for the General Membership Meeting. 

Committees must seek the approval of the General Membership for all campaigns. Committee chairs must report all events and campaigns to the Chapter's Communciation Director for publicity. 

In the event that a committee faces a time-sensitive motion that cannot be brought before the General Membership before action is required, that committee may bring the motion before the Steering Committee for approval by consent. 

A vote of the General Membership may dismantle committees, brought about by: recommendation of the Steering Committee; or recommendation by any General Member, for reasons such as violating DSA Sacramento bylaws. Committees may also self-dismantle at any time. 

The Chapter's Secretary or Communications Director will be responsible for deleting defunct committees from the chapter-wide communications applications. 

Committees are expected to help manage press inquiries regarding committee business. 

Committees must conduct yearly, publicized elections. Elections should be publicized at minimum of 2 weeks in advance. 

#### Committee Membership

Committee membership in SacDSA shall be defined in at least one of these three ways;

1.) You were one of the three five  signatories supporting the committee’s formation and are regularly attending committee meetings as indicated in meeting notes.
2.) You have attended two consecutive committee meetings and your attendance is recorded in the committee’s reported notes.
3.) You are the elected co-chair(s) of the committee

Only SacDSA members in good standing are allowed to call themselves committee members.

There shall be no limitation on how many committees one member in good standing can join.

## Working Groups.

Ideas for Working Groups must be proposed in front of the General Membership. At that time, two dues-paying members in total must come forward, stating their willingness to participate in the working group. The purpose of the working group, as well as the expected end-date of the project, must also be stated. 

Following the proposal, the General Membership will vote whether or not to give permission to proceed with the working group. A working group needs to acquire a simple majority vote in favor in order to proceed. 

Working groups must report to the Steering Committee. All working group actions must be brought before the Steering Committee for consent.

Working groups must report all actions and campaigns to the Media Committee for publicity. 

Working groups may seek a deadline extension by vote of the General Membership. 

Working groups may be dismantled by a vote of the General Membership, brought about by: recommendation of the Steering Committee; or recommendation by any General Member, for reasons such as violating DSA Sacramento bylaws. Working groups may also self-dismantle at any time. 

## Membership.

Members of the Sacramento DSA are those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full. It will be the responsibility of members to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the local chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA. 

Individuals whose dues to national DSA are unpaid may still participate as non-voting volunteers. These non-voting volunteers may not hold office, may not chair committees or working groups, and may not count toward quorum.

If a member is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA, or if that member is found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or if that member is found to be under the discipline of any self-defined democratic centralist organization, the Local may vote to expel her/him from DSA. In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prefer written charges against the member in question to the Local Steering Committee, which shall set the date of a Local meeting for deliberations on the charges. The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before that meeting takes place. Expulsion of a member or affiliate member requires a two-thirds vote of the Local meeting. An expelled member may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA. 

## Voting and Election Procedures.

Above-stated quorum requirements must be upheld for all votes and elections. 

Voting in all elections will be conducted by secret ballot, also known as the Australian ballot, either on paper or digitally. 

Other votes not specified above may be conducted as the parliamentarian sees fit. 

Above-stated quorum requirement and voting procedures apply to officer elections and delegate elections. 

At the time of each vote, it must be reiterated that non-dues-paying volunteers must refrain from voting. 

Within 24 hours of each election result, the full voting totals must be released to the general membership. 

## Prohibited Activities.

DSA Sacramento shall not engage in activity prohibited by the IRS guidelines established for 501 (c) 4 organizations or similar rules established by the state of California. DSA Sacramento shall not engage in any activity prohibited by resolutions adopted by DSA’s National Convention or DSA’s National Political Committee.

DSA Sacramento will maintain an environment free of discrimination and harassment as defined by the Ontario Human Rights Code.

It shall be convened once per every calendar year and requires a Voting Quorum.

Section 2.

The Steering Committee is required to facilitate an annual Local Convention[*]. All convention rules shall be written by ad hoc working group, be posted to the entire membership 30 days in advance of a Local Convention, be amendable, and require ratification by 2⁄3 majority at the commencement of the Local Convention.

## Rules of the Local.

The Rules contained in Robert’s Rules of Order, Newly Revised, shall govern this Local in cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these Bylaws. Consensus decision-making is desirable where feasible, but meetings must submit to Robert’s Rules of Order upon the request of a member.

Any action taken by an officer or member of the Local in contravention of these Bylaws is null and void.

## Chapter Electoral Endorsements.

All of the chapter’s electoral endorsements, whether they are for a candidate or a ballot measure campaign, must be approved through a vote by the membership.  

Endorsements shall only be approved by a 2⁄3 majority vote of a quorum of 5% of the chapter’s general membership.

The process for considering a candidate for chapter endorsement shall follow the following steps.

1. The candidate (or an appropriate representative of the candidate), or a member in good standing representing a ballot measure campaign, shall contact the steering committee to request a vote for the chapter endorsement.
1.  Either one or both co-chairs shall be in contact with the candidate or representative. The co-chair(s) shall send the candidate our chapter’s endorsement questionnaire.  
1. A candidate seeking our endorsement must return their questionnaire no later than 6 months before the date of their election to be considered for a chapter endorsement.  
1. Upon receiving the completed candidate questionnaire, a forum conducted by the chapter’s electoral committee open to the entire chapter membership shall take place with the candidate no later than 5 months before the election date.  If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, this task shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. Following the forum, the chapter’s electoral committee shall vote on a recommendation for the endorsement.  Following the vote, a recommendation either in favor or against endorsement shall be written by representatives of the electoral committee for the membership to review.  If the committee cannot come to a united consensus, then both the cases for and against the endorsement must be written into the report. If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, these tasks shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. The report from the forum shall be presented to the membership at least 5 months before the election date for the members to vote on.  The report shall be presented either during a general membership meeting or online via email depending on the timeframe between the forum and election.  If quorum is met, the endorsement can be voted on at the general membership meeting.  In cases where quorum is not met or if postponing a vote to a general membership meeting would push past the deadline, the vote shall take place online via opavote.
1. Online votes must remain open until the 5% quorum for participation is reached so long as it does not conflict with the 5 month deadline.  If quorum is not met before the appropriate deadline, the motion for the endorsement fails.

In cases where a member(s) is seeking our endorsement for a ballot measure campaign, the member shall follow the following steps:

1. The member(s) shall draft a resolution about the campaign for the membership to read that clearly illustrates the issues the measure will address, including:
    1. why the issue aligns with SacDSA’s priorities
    1. what labor the chapter is expected to provide
    1. an estimate of any anticipated financial expenses the chapter might face by participating in the campaign.
1. The resolution shall be introduced to the membership no later than 6 months before the measure’s election date.
1. The member(s) shall present the resolution at the soonest general membership meeting, or if time does not permit a special forum will be organized in the same manner as a candidate forum. If SacDSA’s electoral committee cannot fulfill this duty, this task shall be deferred to the steering committee.
1. If quorum is met at the general membership meeting, the endorsement can be voted on.  In cases where quorum is not met, the vote shall take place via online polls.
1. Online votes must remain open until the 5% quorum for participation is reached.
1. Any member(s) who introduces a resolution to endorse a ballot measure campaign is knowingly taking on full responsibility as our chapter representative(s) for that campaign and shall report to the general membership with regular updates.  If the member is not willing or able to act as the chapter representative, they must find one upon introduction of the resolution for a vote.

If the chapter votes to make an endorsement, this means the chapter’s general membership is in agreement that the chapter shall:

1. Provide some form of volunteer labor for the campaign such as sending canvassers, phone bankers, text bankers, at large committee volunteers, host fundraisers, host canvassing events, or anything else that is agreed upon by the membership at the time of the endorsement vote.
1. Decide whether the chapter’s endorsement will take the form of an Independent Expenditure (IE) Campaign or a Coordinated Campaign (CC).[^1]
1. Develop a relationship with the endorsed candidate, staffers, and/or representatives of a ballot measure campaign that will continue after the election.
1. Give priority consideration to endorsements for candidates who are members in good standing, provided the member has followed the procedure laid out above.
1. Understand that SacDSA endorsements are not just symbolic gestures, but are physical and potentially financial commitments we make as a chapter that will require the use of chapter resources.

If a candidate or campaign is exposed for doing anything antithetical to DSA’s values, the steering committee is within its right to call a special meeting of the general membership to vote on retracting the endorsement.  Endorsement retractions must meet the same voting quorums listed above and be conducted either in general meetings or online.

[^1]: An IE means we as a chapter would run our own campaign for the candidate or measure and have less restrictions on the amounts we can spend on the campaign, but could legally not coordinate with the main campaign and would require more intense accounting of our campaign expenses and donations to avoid legal complications.  A CC is a campaign where we are in direct contact with the main campaign and would be limited to approximately $5000 in donations per election cycle but require less legal oversight for campaign donations and expenses.
